  The dynamics of scattering on light nuclei is well understood, but its
  calculation is numerically difficult using standard methods.
  Fortunately, using recent developments, the relevant quantities can
  be factored into a product of the $n$-body transition density
  amplitude (TDA) and
  the interaction kernel of a chosen probe.
  These TDAs depend only on the target, and not the
  probe; they are calculated once and stored.
  The kernels depend on only the probe and not the target, they can
  be reused for different targets.
  The calculation of the transition densities becomes numerically
  difficult for $n\ge4$, but we discuss a solution through use of a
  renormalization
  group transformation.
  This technique allows for extending the TDA method to $\LiS$.
  We present preliminary results for Compton scattering on $\LiS$ and
  compare with available data.
  We also discuss extension to pion-photoproduction and other reactions.

\section{Introduction}
Effective field theories (EFTs) in nuclear physics provide a
framework for making precise predictions by employing only those
degrees of freedom that are most pertinent to the physical system
under consideration, rather than relying on the complete set of
intrinsic degrees of freedom present in the underlying theory
(typically quarks and gluons). In this work, we utilize chiral
effective field theory which adopts hadrons
as its fundamental degrees of freedom.
The present study is concerned with the scattering of probes off
light nuclei. To this end, the transition density approximation (TDA)
method was developed by Grie\ss hammer \textit{et al.} and de Vries
\textit{et al.}~\cite{hammer2020, Vries2024}. The TDA formalism
describes the interaction of a probe with an $A$-body target.
Consequently, the probe may interact with up to $A$ nucleons. The $n$ nucleons with which the probe
interacts are designated as \textit{active}, whereas the remaining
$A-n$ nucleons are referred to as \textit{spectators}. The
mathematical treatment of these two components is entirely distinct:
the active $n$ nucleons contribute to the $n$-body kernel, while the
spectator nucleons contribute to $n$-body the TDA.

The $n$-body kernel characterizes the interaction in reduced case
in which the probe interacts exclusively with the $n$-body
system. For example, the one-body kernel in Compton scattering
encompasses the same contributions as those arising in Compton
scattering off a single nucleon. This complete separation of the
contributions implies that if one has access to $a$ distinct kernels
and $b$ distinct TDAs, then a total of $ab$ different outcomes may be
generated. Figure~\ref{fig:onetwobod} provides an illustrative
example for the case $A=3$.

For scattering off an $A$-body nucleus, the total scattering
amplitude is given by \ques{you want a citation here but I think I am the first person to actually write this down. I can cite the $\HeT$ paper if you want.}
\begin{align}
  A_{M}^{M^{\prime} }(\bv{k}, \bv{q})&=\binom{A}{1}\left\langle
  M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{1}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\left|M\right
  \rangle + \binom{A}{2} \left\langle
  M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{2}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q}) \left|
  M\right\rangle
  &+... + \binom{A}{A}\left\langle
  M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{A}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\left|M\right
  \rangle
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  A_{M}^{M^{\prime} }(\bv{k}, \bv{q})&=
 \left\langle M^{\prime}\left|
  \binom{A}{1} \hat{O}_{1}(\bv{k}, \bv{q}) +
  \binom{A}{2} \hat{O}_{2}(\bv{k}, \bv{q}) +... + 
  \binom{A}{A} \hat{O}_{A}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})
  \right|M
  \right\rangle
\end{align}
where $\hat{O}_i$ is the $i$-body kernel, $M,M'$ is the spin projection of the
target nucleus, and there are
$\binom{A}{i}$ ways for a probe to hit $i$ nucleons. Fortunately,
$\chi$EFT provides a hierarchy of scales which predicts decreasing
contributions for higher order terms for probe energies greater than
$\sim 40 \MeV$.
Therefore, the 3-body contribution and higher is negligible at this
order, and we simply use
\begin{equation}
  A_{M}^{M^{\prime} }(\bv{k}, \bv{q})=\binom{A}{1}\left\langle
  M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{3}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\left|M\right
  \rangle + \binom{A}{2} \left\langle
  M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{2}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q}) \left|
  M\right\rangle\nonumber\\
\end{equation}
In practice this is enough for accuracy on roughly the 5\% level.
\section{Kernels and Densities}
The one-body and two-body kernel must be considered separately.
Their form is different, and they require a one- and
two-body density respectively.
Symbolically, the matrix element $\hat{O}_3$ is:
\begin{align}
  \left\langle M^{\prime}\left|\hat{O}_{1}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\right|
  M\right\rangle&=\sum_{\alpha \alpha^{\prime}} \int \mathrm{d}
  p_{12} p_{12}^{2} \mathrm{~d} p_{3} p_{3}^{2} \mathrm{~d}
  p_{12}^{\prime} p_{12}^{\prime 2} \mathrm{~d} p_{3}^{\prime}
  p_{3}^{\prime 2}
  \psi_{\alpha^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\left(p_{12}^{\prime}
  p_{3}^{\prime}\right) \psi_{\alpha}\left(p_{12} p_{3}\right)\nonumber \\
  &\times\left\langle p_{12}^{\prime}
  p_{3}^{\prime}\left[\left(l_{12}^{\prime} s_{12}^{\prime}\right)
    j_{12}^{\prime}\left(l_{3}^{\prime} s_{3}\right)
  j_{3}^{\prime}\right] J^{\prime} M^{\prime}\left(t_{12}^{\prime}
  t_{3}\right) T^{\prime} M_{T}\right| \hat{O}_{1}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})
  \label{onebodFull}\\
  &\qquad\qquad\left|p_{12} p_{3}\left[\left(l_{12} s_{12}\right)
  j_{12}\left(l_{3} s_{3}\right) j_{3}\right] J M\left(t_{12}
  t_{3}\right) T M_{T}\right\rangle.\nonumber
\end{align}
The central result is that up to relativistic corrections, this can
be written as:
\begin{align}
  \left\langle M^{\prime}\left|\hat{O}_{1}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\right|
  M\right\rangle=\sum_{\substack{m_{3}^{s \prime}\,
  m_{3}^{s}\\m_3^t}}\hat{O}_{1}\left(m_{3}^{s \prime} m_{3}^{s},
  m_{3}^{t} ;  \bv{k}, \bv{q}\right) \rho_{m_{3}^{s \prime}
  m_{3}^{s}}^{m_3^{t} M_{T}, M^{\prime} M}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\label{onebodyOrig}\;.
\end{align}
For full details see Grei{\ss}hammer \etal\cite{hammer2020}.
Here $\rho$, is the \textit{one-body transition density amplitude} (TDA)
for the nucleus which was discussed previously and can truly be
interpreted as the probability amplitude that nucleon $m_3^t$ absorbs
momentum $\bv{q}$, changes its spin projection from $m_s^3$ to
$m_s^{3'}$ and changes the spin-projection of the nucleus from $M$ to
$M'$. Its operator form is
\begin{equation}
  \rho_{m_{3}^{\prime} m_{3}^{s}}^{m_{3}^{t} M_{T}, M^{\prime}
  M}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})=\left\langle M^{\prime}\right.\left|s_{3}
  m_{3}^{s \prime}, t_{3} m_{3}^{t}\right\rangle
  \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \frac{2}{3} \bv{q} \cdot
  \bv{r}_{3}}\left\langle s_{3} m_{3}^{s}, t_{3}
  m_{3}^{t}\right|\left. M\right\rangle\label{onebodydens}.
\end{equation}
The two body case works similarly, and results in
\begin{equation}
  \left\langle M^{\prime}\left|\hat{O}_{2}\right| M\right\rangle =
  \sum_{\alpha_{11}^{\prime}, \alpha_{12}} \int \mathrm{d} p_{12}\:
  p_{12}^{2} \mathrm{~d} p_{12}^{\prime}\: p_{12}^{\prime 2}\;
  O_{2}^{\alpha_{12}^{\prime} \alpha_{12}}\left(p_{12}^{\prime},
  p_{12}\right) \rho_{\alpha_{12}^{\prime} \alpha_{12}}^{M_{T},
  M^{\prime} M}\left(p_{12}^{\prime}, p_{12} ; \bv{q}\right)\label{twobody}\;.
\end{equation}
This is the two-body equivalent to \eqref{onebodyOrig}.
There is an expression analogous to \eqref{onebodFull} but it is
non-trivial and for our purposes non-enlightening.
This two-body density $\rho_{\alpha_{12}^{\prime}
\alpha_{12}}^{M_{T}, M^{\prime} M}$ is of course distinct
from the one-body density.
Moreover, just like the one-body case, it can also be interpreted as a
probability density.
It depends on the incoming and outgoing quantum numbers
$\alpha_{12}$ and $\alpha_{12}'$ of the 1-2 system, and also on the initial and final
relative momenta $p_{12} and p_{12}'$ of the two nucleons which are integrated over.
As a result, the file size for the two nucleon densities is approximately 20 MiB
per energy and angle, whereas those of the one
nucleon densities are on the order of a few KB.
Importantly, $\rho$ can be computed directly from a nuclear
potential, such as the chiral SMS potential
\cite{Reinert2018}
without reference to the kernel $\hat{O}_1$ or $\hat{O}_{2}$.

\section{SRG Transformation}
Previous work using the TDA formalism has analyzed
$\HeT$ and $\HeF$
\cite{hammer2020, hammer4He}
, but to extend this to $\LiS$ involves many-body
interactions which are much more complicated and computationally expensive.
To make the calculation of a TDA feasible for $A=6$, a
\textit{similarity renormalization group} (SRG) transformation
is employed \cite{SRG, Furnstahl2013}.
This is of much experimental interest since $\LiS$ is a stable solid at room temperature and is
therefore relatively simple to conduct an experiment on, even to high precision due to its relatively large
cross section and count rate.
There have been many experiments on $\LiS$ \cite{60MeV,86MeV}, yet to date there is no theory prediction,
we seek to fill in this gap.
When using nuclear potentials, we approximate the nucleon-nucleon potential to be zero
beyond a certain cutoff $\LamNN$, and consequently
neglect contributions above this cutoff in our calculations.
In general, a nuclear potential, such as the chiral SMS potential does
not fall off rapidly at high momenta \cite{Reinert2018}.
As a result we would have to
extend the cutoff $\LamNN$ much further than is desirable, which in turn
increases computational cost.
The SRG transformation is a unitary transformation that
shifts the relevant physics into the low-momentum
region, thereby lowering minimum effective $\LamNN$ in the SRG evolved space.
This, in turn, significantly improves the convergence rate of calculations for $A=6$.
The SRG transformation can be thought of as a local averaging or
smoothing of the potential, resulting in decreased resolution
has the SRG is applied.

  }
  \label{fig:SRGtransform}
\end{figure}
In the under-evolved, high resolution figure \ref{fig:highres} the potential does 
not go to zero rapidly, whereas it does once the
transformation is applied in figure \ref{fig:lowres}. As a
result a cutoff can be made at $\LamNN=2 \mathrm{fm}^{-1}$ without
losing much accuracy whereas the under-evolved potential required at least $\LamNN=5 \mathrm{fm}^{-1}$.
The time complexity is at minimum proportional to the number of array elements
present, therefore we gain a factor of $(5/2)^2=6.25$ in efficiency;
in practice the gains are even higher.

The SRG transformation is essential, but it also creates a
change in the physical meaning of the free variables.
In fact, any unitary transformation ($U^\dag U =\mathbbm{1}$) also transforms the coordinates.
\begin{align}
  \br{p'}V\kt{p} 
  = \br{p'} U^\dag U V U^\dag U \kt{p}
  = \br{p'} U^\dag\left( U V U^\dag\right)\;U
  \kt{p}
  = \br{\widetilde{p}\,'} V_{eff}
  \kt{\widetilde{p}}=V_{eff}(\widetilde{p},\widetilde{p}\,')
\end{align}
So referring to the free variables in an SRG-transformed potential as
``momenta'' is, to some extent, incorrect.
They do not represent physical states  in the sense that they are not eigenstates to physical momenta.
The Lagrangeans that generate the Feynman diagrams in the kernel, however,
depend on physical momenta, and therefore we cannot directly use an SRG
evolved potential in the non-SRG evolved kernel.
To solve this, previous work with SRG transformations has transformed the
Lagrangeans - and therefore the kernels - into the SRG evolved space
as well\ques{get citation}.
However, in the context of the density formalism this would mean adding SRG
dependence into the kernel, thereby breaking kernel-density independence.
Additionally, the SRG transformation can take many different forms \cite{SRG, Furnstahl2013};
we wish to allow for these developments
without having to re-write the kernel code.
Therefore we have chosen to apply an inverse
transformation to the densities \cite{XiangXiang}.

The SRG evolution has parameters that must be fine-tuned, but this
allows for uncertainty estimation.
In particular, one must solve for the nucleus wavefunction; 
to this end an expansion in the harmonic oscillator basis is used.
When expanded to infinite order, this basis forms a complete set,
however, we truncate this expansion by including harmonic oscillator excitations up to $\Ntot$.
Additionally, the harmonic oscillator basis has a characteristic
width, denoted by $\omega_H$, and finally, the parameter $\LamSRG$
represents the evolution of the potential, as seen in figure
\ref{fig:SRGtransform}. $\LamSRG=\infty$ corresponds to no evolution.
All of these parameters affect the resulting cross-section.
We note that uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing
$\Ntot$, and at $\Ntot=\infty$ the associated uncertainty goes to zero.
Applying a stronger SRG evolution (lower $\LamSRG$) to the potential results in larger
induced many-body forces; however, we show in figure \ref{fig:SRGConverge4He} the
effect of this uncertainty is small.
These induced forces exist because due to the cutoff $\LamNN$ the SRG transformation
is only approximately unitary.
Fortunately, when the TDA is calculated we also gain access to the
binding energy of the simulated system.
From this, we can estimate required values for $\omega_H$ and
$\Ntot$ by comparing the experimental binding energy to computed
binding energy.
In order to gain confidence we first applied this methodology 
to $\HeF$, where we can compare SRG and non-SRG evolved results. 
With this completed we have now moved to $\LiS$ where we only have access to 
the SRG evolved form.

\end{equation}
In figure \ref{fig:SRGConverge4He}, we see the effectiveness of the
results in the $\HeF$ case.
We expect the deviation to decrease as $N$ increases, and importantly
for our analysis, this shows what value of $N$ is required.
The small error present at high $\Ntot$ is present do to the induced many body forces.

\section{Using TDAs in different processes}
With the TDAs calculated for Compton scattering, we now wish to recycle them for new processes.
In particular pion-photoproduction, and
pion scattering are of interest.
Fortunately their kernels share remarkable similarity since if one ignores the type of incoming/outgoing 
particle the processes are topologically identical.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{file_path}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{KernelSim.pdf}
\caption{Topologically identical diagrams in Compton scattering, pion-photoproduction, and pion scattering}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Pion-Photoproduction}
For the pion-photoproduction one-body kernel, we use the results from
a single nucleon scattering, $\gamma N \to \pi N$ which has
been studied extensively \cite{pionphoto,
Rijneveen2021,Workman2012,Briscoe2023}.
Its differential cross section can be decomposed into the
electric and magnetic multipoles $E_{l\pm}, M_{l\pm}$ \cite{pionphoto}.
Over the years, many experimental results have measured
these multipoles to high order and with good precision
\cite{multipolePionPion}.
The resulting scattering matrices $\mathcal{M}$ are exactly what
enters as $\hat{O}_1$ in equation (\ref{onebodyOrig}).
This approach solves a significant problem since the calculation of
the one-body pion-photoproduction kernel
to high accuracy directly from Feynman diagrams requires including many terms
in the chiral expansion due to the proximity of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance at $\sim 200\MeV$ \cite{Rijneveen2021}.


The two-body contributions do not easily decompose into multipoles
, therefore we perform the calculation through expansions
in the chiral Lagrangean through calculation of Feynman diagrams.
It is likely this will lead to large uncertainties, as in the one-body case.
At threshold energy, this reaction kernel has been analyzed by
Lenkewitz \etal \cite{L2011, L2013}.
We now have a numerically stable result for $\HeT$ and seek to extend
this approach to new targets.
\ques{Include some numbers, need to discuss with you uncertainty analysis.}
\subsection{Pion scattering and other reactions}
Beane \etal have developed the pion-pion kernel at threshold for both
one-body and two-body interactions \cite{Beane2003}.
We may extend this analysis to finite energy.
Once the pion-photoproduction and pion-pion scattering kernels have
successfully been developed, we will be able to calculate all of
these reactions on previously analyzed targets in the density
formalism since we already have produced the TDAs required.
In particular, we will calculate all of these reactions with the
targets $\HThree$, $\HeT$, $\HeF$, and $\LiS$.

\section{Conclusion}
We have developed and demonstrated a comprehensive framework for
computing scattering observables in light nuclei by factorizing the
full amplitude into target‐dependent few-body transition density
amplitudes (TDAs) and probe‐dependent interaction kernels.
This separation allows us to treat the nuclear structure and the
reaction mechanism independently, thereby streamlining the
calculation of observables.
The central achievement of this work is the successful extension of
the density formalism to heavier targets like $\LiS$ by incorporating a
similarity renormalization group (SRG) transformation.
The SRG not only accelerates the convergence of our calculations by
lowering the effective momentum cutoff, but—when combined with an
appropriate inverse transformation of the densities—also preserves
the kernel–density independence that is crucial for the versatility
of our approach.
Furthermore, we have presented the computation of Compton scattering on $\LiS$ which agrees
well with data and we have outlined the extension of the formalism to other
reactions, such as pion-photoproduction and pion-pion scattering. The
ability to plug in different reaction kernels into the same TDA
framework not only enhances the predictive power of our approach but
also paves the way for a unified treatment of various scattering
processes in few-body systems.
Ultimately, this framework provides a promising route toward
high-precision theoretical predictions, deepening our understanding
of nuclear dynamics in light nuclei.
