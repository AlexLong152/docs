Factor into probe interaction with active nucleons (kernel) and spectator nucleon behavior (density)\\~\\

\begin{frame}{Overview}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.07]{kinematics3He-1bod.png}
\end{center}
    Probe interacts with $n$ active nucleons $\implies$ \textit{$n$ body kernel} $\implies$ \textit{$n$ body transition density}.
Density independent of probe, kernel independent of density\\~\\
Transition density $\rho$ is the probability amplitude of a nucleus with quantum numbers $\kt{M_J}$ to absorb the momentum $\vec{q}=\vec{k}_2-\vec{k}_1$ and change into quantum numbers $\kt{M_J'}$

\begin{frame}{Total Contribution}
For an $n$ body system, total scattering amplitude is:
\begin{align*}
    A_{M}^{M^{\prime} }(\bv{k}, \bv{q})&=\binom{A}{1}\left\langle M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{3}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\left|M\right \rangle + \binom{A}{2} \left\langle M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{12}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q}) \left| M\right\rangle\\
        &+ \binom{A}{3}\left\langle M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{123}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\left|M\right \rangle + \binom{A}{4} \left\langle M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{1234}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q}) \left| M\right\rangle\\
        &+... + \binom{A}{A}\left\langle M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{1...A}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\left|M\right \rangle
\end{align*}
$\binom{A}{i}$ ways to hit $i$ nucleons in a nucleus with $A$ nuclei
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{frame}{Truncated Result}
We use only the first two terms
\begin{equation*}
    A_{M}^{M^{\prime} }(\bv{k}, \bv{q})=\binom{A}{1}\left\langle M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{3}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q})\left|M\right \rangle + \binom{A}{2} \left\langle M^{\prime}\right|\hat{O}_{12}^{}(\bv{k}, \bv{q}) \left| M\right\rangle
\end{equation*}
~\\
Higher order density suppressed by $Q^i$ in this case. $\chi$EFT provides this ordering scheme.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Depends on quantum numbers of probe (helicity), and quantum numbers of nucleus $M, M^{'}  $\\

    \item One and two body densities only\\~\\
    \item Convergence pattern, truncation error \\~\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mathcal{O}= \mathcal{O}_0 Q^0 +\mathcal{O}_1 Q^1+\mathcal{O}_2 Q^2+...$\\~\\
    \end{itemize}
    \item Finite order in expansion parameter $Q$\\~\\
    \item Different cutoffs $\Lambda$ in densities, estimate of residual dependence\\~\\

\begin{frame}\frametitle{SRG vs Fourier Transform}
Fourier transforms are discrete unitary transformations
\begin{align*}
    V(\vec{r},\vec{r}\,')&= \br{r'} V \kt{r}\\
                         &= \int \dd^3p\, \dd^3p' \brkt{r'}{p'} \br{p'}V\kt{p} \brkt{p}{r}\\
                         &= V(\vec{p},\vec{p}\,')
\end{align*}
After the transform our free variables have different physical meaning.\\
SRG is similar and it creates problems
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%




\begin{frame}{SRG Variables}
Any unitary transform, also transforms the coordinates
\begin{align*}
    \br{p'}V\kt{p} &= \br{p'} \mathbbm{1} V \mathbbm{1} \kt{p}\\
                   &= \br{p'} U^\dag U V U^\dag U \kt{p}\\
                   &= \left(\br{p'} U^\dag\right)\;\left( U V U^\dag\right)\;\left( U \kt{p}\right)\\
                   &= \br{\widetilde{p}\,'} V_{eff} \kt{\widetilde{p}}
\end{align*}
Calling the free parameters in the SRG potential ``momenta" is abuse of notation. They are not physical momenta.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%




\begin{frame}\frametitle{Density Calculation}
SRG changes Hamiltonian $\implies$ changes Lagrangian $\implies$ diagram contribution changes, and momenta aren't
physical\\~\\
One option: do a unitary transform of diagrams and kernels
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{UUdag.pdf}
\end{center}
Problem: This breaks kernel - target (density) independence. Would have to introduce SRG $\lambda$ dependence into the code\\
\qquad - Effectively would give SRG dependence on Lagrangian and therefore the diagrams.
